# Trip-Split
TripSplit - Collaborative Expense Tracker
TripSplit is a full-stack, cross-platform application designed to simplify expense tracking for groups and trips. Built with a Flutter frontend and a Node.js backend, it provides a real-time, transparent way for users to manage shared finances, from initial contributions to final settlements.

‚ú® Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Trip Management: Users can create new trips and will be able to invite others to join.

Expense Logging: Add expenses with descriptions and amounts to a specific trip.

Real-time Updates: (Planned) Live synchronization of expenses across all trip members' devices.

Secure Endpoints: Protected API routes ensure that only authorized members can view or modify trip data.

Clear Summaries: (Planned) A detailed breakdown of who paid for what and who owes whom, simplifying settlements.
