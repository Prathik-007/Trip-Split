//blueprint for what a "trip" is in our database.
/* 
 Before we can save a trip, our database needs to know exactly what information a trip should contain. The model enforces these rules. We decided that every trip must have:
A name (like "Paris Adventure").
A createdBy field, which stores the ID of the user who created it. The ref: 'User' part is crucialâ€”it creates a direct link between the trip and a specific user.
A list of members, which is an array that will hold the IDs of everyone on the trip.
